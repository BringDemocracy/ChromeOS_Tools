Hello, to use this tool, just enable the debugging tool in linux environnement in setting, it only reboot the laptop it will not factory reset the laptop
and you only need to run those line to install those dependencies in the linux terminal :
sudo apt install adb
sudo apt install python3-tk


and this one, once you configured apk_installer.desktop move it to the following directory and run this command to make the file executable as an application but you can just run the python program if u prefer 
chmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/apk_installer.desktop
